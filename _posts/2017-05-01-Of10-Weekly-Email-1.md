##### Email Subject: Never Say Never #####

Hello All,

First off, I would like to welcome team AutoNinja to Of10! What does Auto Ninja do you ask? They make automatic weapons for Ninja warriors across Japan..duh. Talk to them, they may slide a shuriken your way.

So this is what’s up this week.

#### We feel a little bloated: ####

Maybe it was just too much biryani, but we are feeling a little full at Of10. As you can see, we are at capacity. It is a brave new world for us so allow us time while we acclimatise.

#### Game Night: ####

Remember how we did a board game night last week? Well we are doing a bigger one this Saturday. So quit playing games with my heart and play games with me.

#### Hamster Comedy: ####

I know for a fact that everyone at Of10 loves going for comedy nights. You, however never make it to ours. Here’s hoping for new beginnings: We have a fantastic lineup this weekend.
