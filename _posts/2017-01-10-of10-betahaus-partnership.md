Of10 members now have exclusive access to all Betahaus coworking locations through Europe.

You could revel in the Raval in Barcelona, hunt down bargains in Mauer Park of Berlin, take a boat tour to get a taste of the maritime culture in Hamburg or indulge in a food tour in Sofia in your free time. All this packed with a one-two punch of the a fantastic coworking community.

With this collaboration, we wish to redefine the future of work and celebrate the working nomad.
