**Kylie Jenner is a sensation. She’s made millions for herself and the brands she endorses.**

*Ever wondered how’d she do it?*

You keep scrolling through your Instagram timeline, double tapping on all the #fashionbloggers pictures, not having a clue how they even started something like that!

In today’s era, online success = real life success. No matter how blah that sounds, that’s the harsh reality. You might be the best at what you do, but if you're not blogging about it, you don't exist. It's essential to have a well-groomed web presence. Whatever type of content you want to promote, your blog is fundamental to spread the word, with social media as the whipped cream on top to attract more readers.

Blogging is not about writing an essay; it's about weaving words to communicate from your heart, while creating an (even if small) impact.

You might be a style babe, an artist, or an entrepreneur, grabbing the attention of your tribe is a prerequisite.
