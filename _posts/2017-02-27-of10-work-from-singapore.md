So, you have set up your business in India and it’s going well.
In fact, you believe that the value proposition you are offering is different than others.
How do you scale to another part of the globe with little or no risk?

Moving to a new country is no mean feat.
There are various factors that determine the success of your product.
If only you could test your product on a small target audience before you deploy it wholesale or
if you could have talented local entrepreneurs guide you through your expansion.
These are the value propositions Of10 can now offer you as part of its “Work from Anywhere” program.

[Collision 8](https://www.collision8.com/ "Collision8's Homepage")

We have collaborated with a co-working space in Singapore to provide international opportunities.

The work space has a bar, library and panoramic views of Marina Bay Sands, Boat Quay and Fort Canning Park.
The 8,600 sq ft space is on the eighth floor of the posh High Street Center.

Collision 8 is like Of10 wherein it is a private members' club.
They select members on the basis of their desire to innovate and collaborate.

They have over 70 members and also have partnerships with about 40 companies which provide wide range of services at discounted rates.

Of10 members will get the following benefits from this partnership:

- Collision 8 will provide Of10 members with immediate Singapore branch

- Collision 8 will provide Of10 members with a FREE work space in Singapore when our members travel

- They will allow Of10 members to assist their ecosystem to expand into Singapore.

Expanding to another country has never been easier. At Of10, we continue to help startups and smaller businesses compete by giving them benefits through the power of collaboration and co-working.
