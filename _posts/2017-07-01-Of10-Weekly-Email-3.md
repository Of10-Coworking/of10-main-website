##### Email Subject: Covfefe #####

Hello Chill-Scenes but yet want to party, people, I moved my email a day forward because…I can.

So here’s the roundup for this week!

#### Ta- na na ta-na na tana naaaa ####

That is not my rendition of tunak tunak tun, it is the theme song for Game of Thrones! Episode one airs today at 6 pm! I’m arranging some popcorn and some Greek Yoghurt(random right, you will see)! What is dead may never die.

#### GST workshop ####

We have some accounting guys volunteering to conduct a ‘demystifying GST' workshop for all our members here at Of10. If interested in attending please respond to this email. Fun times are to be had.

Oh, and its FREE

#### Can’t snack won’t snack ####

We have a new snack tracking system in place! When purchasing a snack, use our tablet to enter your credentials. It’s an easy online way to buy your snacks. It’s in beta, so tell us what you think!

#### New Referral Program! ####

So I did some thinking, I figured, if we like you, we may like your friends. So we came up with a referral program! Every friend you bring in that signs up (not from your company) we will give you a 10% discount on your next months bill!
